    <p id="UX-UI"> User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of supporting user behavior[1] through usability, usefulness, and desirability provided in the interaction with a product.[2] User experience design encompasses traditional human–computer interaction
        (HCI) design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users. Experience design (XD) is the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, channel journeys, and environments with a focus placed
        on the quality of the user experience and culturally relevant solutions.[3] Experience design is not driven by a single design discipline. Instead, it requires a cross-discipline perspective that considers multiple aspects of the brand/ business/
        environment/ experience from product, packaging, and retail environment to the clothing and attitude of employees. Experience design seeks to develop the experience of a product, service, or event along any or all of the following dimensions:[4]
        Duration (initiation, immersion, conclusion, and continuation) Intensity (reflex, habit, engagement) Breadth (products, services, brands, nomenclatures, channels/environment/promotion, and price) Interaction (passive ↔ active ↔ interactive) Triggers
        (all human senses, concepts, and symbols) Significance (meaning, status, emotion, price, and function) <br></p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">Link to Design</a>

    <p id="Frontend development">Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.</p>
