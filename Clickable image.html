    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>In 1999, students Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi of the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi struggle to compete within its cutthroat academic culture. Farhan is passionate about wildlife photography but chose to pursue engineering
        to appease his father, while Raju is simply in need of a career that will rescue his family from poverty. However, their roommate, the eccentric Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad (nicknamed "Rancho"), is genuinely passionate about science and engineering.
        Rancho gives unorthodox answers in class and frequently clashes with the school's staff and its director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (nicknamed "Virus" by its students), since he believes that students should enjoy what they learn, while the school enforces
        a strict, exam-based teaching model. Rancho witnesses the effects of ICE's hyper-competitive academic culture firsthand when a student named Joy Lobo commits suicide after failing to meet a project deadline and being denied graduation by Virus.
        Rancho confronts Virus about the undue pressure placed on ICE students to succeed, but his rebellious behavior at the school puts a strain on Farhan and Raju's relationships with their own families. Raju attempts to distance himself from Rancho,
        but when Raju's paralyzed father experiences a medical emergency, Rancho saves his life with the help of Virus' younger daughter Pia, who begins to fall in love with Rancho. At the end of the year, Rancho is shown to have topped the school's rankings
        despite his disdain for its academic system, while Farhan and Raju continue to fall behind.</p>
    <h2>Cast</h2>
    <p>Aamir Khan as Ranchoddas "Rancho" Shamaldas Chanchad / Chhote / Phunsukh Wangdu, one of the titular trio in the engineering college who vanishes after graduation and whom his two friends hunt for ten years while telling stories of their time in college
        together. Rancho was a prodigal student, with contempt for the inhumanity of the college's system. At the end of the film, he is shown to be a famous scientist, entrepreneur, and business magnate who also teaches young children when he takes a
        break from researching. R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi, the film's narrator and one of the trio whose father persuades him to study engineering over his dream career of wildlife photography; in the end, he is shown to have published several books
        of photographs. Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi, another of the trio who comes from an impoverished family with a mother who is a retired school teacher and a paralyzed father who worked as a postman. In the flashback story, his family was unable
        to afford the car that would be demanded as a dowry for his sister. In the present story, he is a settled married man in Delhi who has freed his family from poverty by becoming a wealthy executive. Kareena Kapoor Khan as Pia Sahastrabuddhe, Virus'
        younger daughter, an intelligent and capable doctor. Despite her father's disapproval, she and Rancho fall in love. Boman Irani as Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe, the college's strict director known as "Virus" and Pia and Mona's father who acts as the
        film's antagonist. He stubbornly sticks to a doctrinal method of teaching, putting him at odds with Rancho. At the end, he is shown to have changed his doctrinal methods of teaching. Omi Vaidya as Chatur Ramalingam, a Ugandan-Indian educated in
        Tamil-speaking Pondicherry who has little knowledge of Hindi, and Rancho's rival. His habit of being gassy due to consumption of pills to enhance his memorisation earns him the nickname Silencer. In the present story, he is vice-president of an
        American company (Rockledge Corporation) who discovers his success being overshadowed by Rancho in the end of the film. Baradwaj Rangan wrote that Chatur being a Tamil from Uganda makes him "twice removed from the North Indians around him – a
        stranger to the nation as well as the national language."[29]</p>
