    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p id="Plot">Karthik and Kavya are the children of Rama Chandra Rao. Rama Chandra Rao wants to make Karthik a collector. The only problem is that Kavya wants to become a collector as well, but Rama Chandra Rao cannot afford to pay for both of their studies. Because of this, Karthik deliberately fails in his exams so that his sister can join Delhi Public School in order to become a collector. The only one aware of his sacrifice is his uncle.

        Years later, Karthik aka Bruce Lee is a stuntman working under stuntmaster Dangerous David, and Kavya is still the smart girl as she was. Once, Bruce Lee goes in the middle of a shooting to a hotel to save his friend's sister who was being kidnapped. Ria Rao, a game designer, who came there to meet a police officer for marriage, sees Bruce Lee in his police costume and mistakes him for a brave officer. She becomes a fan of him and rejects the other police officer because he is corrupted.
        
        Some days later, Bruce Lee finds out that Ria uploaded the video of him fighting in a police costume on Facebook. When he goes to meet her, he falls in love with and finds out that she is designing a video game called SuperCop based on him. From then, Ria spends time with him continuously, while Karthik is still afraid of revealing his identity as he fears that she might go away from him.
        
        Meanwhile, a terrorist attack occurs in a hotel. Karthik's elder brother Ravi and Commissioner Marthand confirm that it was a terrorist attack. Later, Ravi finds evidence to prove that it was not a terrorist attack but an attempt to kill two rival businessmen by Deepak Raj. He goes to Marthand, but Marthand is actually corrupt and turns Ravi into Deepak, who knocks him unconscious. Meanwhile, Ria keeps getting Bruce Lee into fights thinking that he is an undercover cop.
        
        In the meantime, Kavya writes her final exams needed to become a collector, and while she is returning, Deepak drugs her forcefully and arrests her to trick Ram Gopal, someone trying to get him in jail, to think that it was his daughter. Bruce Lee knows of this and beats up Deepak, sending him into a coma, and returns in time for Kavya's engagement with Rahul, the son of Jayaraj and Vasundhara who are bosses of Rama Chandra Rao. It is shown to us that Deepak is the first son of Jayaraj with an unofficial wife, Malini.
        
        A couple of days later, Ria takes Karthik, who she thinks is still a police officer, to meet her family. Her father is IB Chief Bharadwaj, who knows Bruce Lee's real profession and his background. They both start a mission to capture Jayaraj and Deepak. Following the plan, he joins Jayaraj's company as his assistant and uses Suzuki Subramanyam, an undercover cop, to reveal Jayaraj's secrets to Vasundhara, causing her to leave him. Meanwhile, Deepak captures and shoots Bruce Lee. But Karthik knew their plan that's why he pretend to be dead. Deepak order their henchmen to pack his body in a plastic bag and drop his dead body on nearby canal. His henchman carry out his order and drop his body but Karthik get outside from the plastic bag.
        
        Later, Jayaraj, with his men, tries to kill Vasundhara, Rahul and Kavya. Bruce Lee comes back as he was aware of all of Deepak's plans. This is because they had replaced G. Ramji (Jaya Prakash Reddy), a corrupt inspector, under Deepak's payroll and David's lookalike with David himself. Karthik was actually wearing a bulletproof vest under his shirt, and there were blood bombs in the vest. Deepak's shots caused the bombs to burst.
        
        In the ensuring fight, Bruce Lee kills Deepak and takes his body to Jayaraj, revealing to Jayaraj who he actually is. In revenge, Jayaraj kidnaps Ria and stabs Rama Chandra Rao in front of his eyes after he tells him all about Bruce Lee's sacrifices for his family. Bruce Lee admits his father in the hospital and calls Chiranjeevi for help, who is busy shooting for his 150th movie to help Ria. Chiranjeevi goes and beats up the goons and saves Ria. In the meantime, Suzuki arrests Jayaraj, finishing his last mission before he retires and his first-ever success that he got after being admitted into the police force.
        
        At the last scene of the film during a celebration, Ria asks Karthik to fill up a form and become an actual police officer, to which everyone starts laughing.</p>

        <h3>Production</h3>
    <p id="Production">Sreenu Vaitla narrated a storyline to Ram Charan in late March 2014 and post the latter's approval, Vaitla planned to start work on the film's script after completing Aagadu (2014).[4] DVV Danayya, who produced Ram Charan's Naayak (2013), announced in late July 2014 that he would produce this film under the banner Universal Media and the pre-production works would begin soon. The production was expected to start in November 2014.[5] The film was shelved post the release of Aagadu and was revived in late October 2014.[6] After returning from a holiday in Kerala, Charan gave his nod in early December 2014 and Vaitla was busy giving final touches to the script which was said to be a fast-paced action comedy.[7]

        Charan informed the media that the film's production would commence in February 2015.[8] My Name is Raju, a phrase picked up from the popular song of Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari (1990) starring Chiranjeevi and Sridevi, was considered as the film's title.[9][10] The makers announced that the film would be a family drama and would be bankrolled by Danayya under his new banner DVV Entertainments.[11] The film was launched officially on 5 March 2015 at Danayya's office in Hyderabad.[12] The film was said to be inspired from the basic plot of the Telugu film Vijetha (1985).[13] The makers contemplated to title the film as Bruce Lee in mid May 2015 considering the protagonist's character being a stuntman acting as a body double for actors,[14] which was confirmed in late August 2015.[15]</p>
